## Motivation and project objective

The COVID-19 pandemic has elicited a wide array of measures from policymakers and political authorities. 
Among similar types measures, there is heterogeneity in their stringency or their degree of enforcement. 

Also, the public responds differently to the different types of measures. 

 \textbf{Objectives of this project}
 
- Group US states according to different strategies of COVID containment. 
- Identify variables that are correlated with each group.  
- Understand the public's response to these measures. 

# Analyzing COVID-19 US states' measures

## Data and Methodology
COVID measures dataset: Oxford Policy Tracker

- Follows daily levels of 10 types of COVID measures for the 50 US states. 
- Each variable is an integer taking values from  zero to three or four.
- The higher the value, the higher the restrictions/stringency of the implemented policy. 

Our methodology

- Select the period of 30 days before and after the peak number of new deaths,
- Average the level of response, for each type of variable.
- Compare this average across states

## Are measures better separated by people's affinities or authorities' partisanship?


- We are interested in investigating wether people's preferences are a better segmenting variable than governor's partizanship.
- We leverage the cases where the governor is of the opposite political side of the majority of the population (e.g. A. Schwarzenegger)

- This leads to the following set of states: 

\begin{table}
\resizebox{\textwidth}{!}{
\begin{tabular}{cccc}
\toprule
State & Party & Republican Advantage in Population & Leaning\\
\midrule
Florida & republican & -5.38 & democrat\\
Kansas & democrat & 9.36 & republican\\
Maine & democrat & 9.14 & republican\\
Maryland & republican & -22.24 & democrat\\
Massachusetts & republican & -10.87 & democrat\\
Oklahoma & republican & -5.25 & democrat\\
Vermont & republican & -10.29 & democrat\\
\bottomrule

\end{table}


## In general, segmentation improves

## Summary

- In general we observe states grouped by the types of measures taken during the peak period of the pandemic. 
- Political partizanship of authorities can be a good segmenting variable in the space of measures taken. 
- Grouping by the political leaning of the population in general improves the previous segmentation, especially for heavy democrat states like Vermont, Maryland and Massachusets.
